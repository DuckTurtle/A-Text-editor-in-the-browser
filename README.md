# A Text Editor in the Browser

## Description

I created this project to practice with wepack configuration, and service workers. With these two aplacations I was able to implament asset cashing so the aplaction can be partily used offline and to create an installable aplacation. Durring this project I learned how to properly configure a webpack file to produce the results I wanted, and how to cash data using a service worker.
